/** \defgroup avr_assert <assert.h>: Diagnostics

    This header file defines a debugging aid.

    As there is no standard error output stream available for many
    applications using this library, the generation of a printable
    error message is not enabled by default.  These messages will
    only be generated if the application defines the macro

    \code __ASSERT_USE_STDERR \endcode

    before including the \c <assert.h> header file.  By default,
    only abort() will be called to halt the application.

/**
   \def assert
   \param expression Expression to test for.

   The assert() macro tests the given expression and if it is false,
   the calling process is terminated by calling abort().
   When the macro \c __ASSERT_USE_STDERR was defined prior to including
   \c <assert.h>, then a diagnostic message is written to \c stderr.

   If expression is true, the assert() macro does nothing.

   The assert() macro may be removed at compile time by defining
   NDEBUG as a macro (e.g., by using the compiler option -DNDEBUG).
