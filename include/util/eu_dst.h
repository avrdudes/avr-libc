    Given the time stamp and time zone parameters provided, the Daylight
    Saving function must return a value appropriate for the tm structures'
    tm_isdst element. That is:

    - \c 0 : If Daylight Saving is not in effect.

    - \c -1 : If it cannot be determined if Daylight Saving is in effect.

    - A positive integer: Represents the number of seconds a clock is advanced
    for Daylight Saving.  This will typically be ONE_HOUR.

    Daylight Saving 'rules' are subject to frequent change.  For production
    applications it is recommended to write your own DST function, which
    uses 'rules' obtained from, and modifiable by, the end user (perhaps
    stored in EEPROM).
