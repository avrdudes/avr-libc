/** \defgroup util_atomic <util/atomic.h> Atomically and Non-Atomically Executed Code Blocks

    \code
    #include <util/atomic.h>
    \endcode

    \note The macros in this header file require the ISO/IEC 9899:1999
    ("ISO C99") feature of for loop variables that are declared inside
    the for loop itself.  For that reason, this header file can only
    be used if the standard level of the compiler (option --std=) is
    set to either \c c99, \c gnu99 or higher.

    The macros in this header file deal with code blocks that are
    guaranteed to be executed Atomically or Non-Atomically.  The term
    "Atomic" in this context refers to the inability of the respective
    code to be interrupted.

    These macros operate via automatic manipulation of the Global
    Interrupt Status (I) bit of the SREG register. Exit paths from
    both block types are all managed automatically without the need
    for special considerations, i.e. the interrupt status will be
    restored to the same value it had when entering the respective
    block (unless ATOMIC_FORCEON or NONATOMIC_FORCEOFF are used).
    \warning The features in this header are implemented by means of
    a for loop.  This means that commands like \c break and \c continue
    that are located in an atomic block refer to the atomic for loop,
    not to a loop construct that hosts the atomic block.

    A typical example that requires atomic access is a 16 (or more)
    bit variable that is shared between the main execution path and an
    ISR.  While declaring such a variable as volatile ensures that the
    compiler will not optimize accesses to it away, it does not
    guarantee atomic access to it.  Assuming the following example:

    \code
#include <stdint.h>
#include <avr/interrupt.h>
#include <avr/io.h>

volatile uint16_t ctr;

ISR(TIMER1_OVF_vect)
{
  ctr--;
}

...
int
main(void)
{
   ...
   ctr = 0x200;
   start_timer();
   while (ctr != 0)
     // wait
       ;
   ...
}
    \endcode

    There is a chance where the main context will exit its wait loop
    when the variable \c ctr just reached the value 0xFF.  This happens
    because the compiler cannot natively access a 16-bit variable
    atomically in an 8-bit CPU.  So the variable is for example at
    0x100, the compiler then tests the low byte for 0, which succeeds.
    It then proceeds to test the high byte, but that moment the ISR
    triggers, and the main context is interrupted.  The ISR will
    decrement the variable from 0x100 to 0xFF, and the main context
    proceeds.  It now tests the high byte of the variable which is
    (now) also 0, so it concludes the variable has reached 0, and
    terminates the loop.

    Using the macros from this header file, the above code can be
    rewritten like:

    \code
#include <stdint.h>
#include <avr/interrupt.h>
#include <avr/io.h>
#include <util/atomic.h>

volatile uint16_t ctr;

ISR(TIMER1_OVF_vect)
{
  ctr--;
}

...
int
main(void)
{
   ...
   ctr = 0x200;
   start_timer();
   sei();
   uint16_t ctr_copy;
   do
   {
     ATOMIC_BLOCK(ATOMIC_FORCEON)
     {
       ctr_copy = ctr;
     }
   }
   while (ctr_copy != 0);
   ...
}
    \endcode

    This will install the appropriate interrupt protection before
    accessing variable \c ctr, so it is guaranteed to be consistently
    tested.  If the global interrupt state were uncertain before
    entering the #ATOMIC_BLOCK, it should be executed with the
    parameter #ATOMIC_RESTORESTATE rather than #ATOMIC_FORCEON.

    See \ref optim_code_reorder for things to be taken into account
    with respect to compiler optimizations.
