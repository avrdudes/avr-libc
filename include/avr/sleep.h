    \code #include <avr/sleep.h>\endcode

    Use of the \c SLEEP instruction can allow an application to reduce its
    power consumption considerably. AVR devices can be put into different
    sleep modes. Refer to the datasheet for the details relating to the device
    you are using.

    There are several macros provided in this header file to actually
    put the device into sleep mode.  The simplest way is to optionally
    set the desired sleep mode using \c set_sleep_mode() (it usually
    defaults to idle mode where the CPU is put on sleep but all
    peripheral clocks are still running), and then call
    \c sleep_mode(). This macro automatically sets the sleep enable bit, goes
    to sleep, and clears the sleep enable bit.

    Example:
    \code
    #include <avr/sleep.h>

    ...
      set_sleep_mode(<mode>);
      sleep_mode();
    \endcode

    Note that unless your purpose is to completely lock the CPU (until a
    hardware reset), interrupts need to be enabled before going to sleep.

    As the \c sleep_mode() macro might cause race conditions in some
    situations, the individual steps of manipulating the sleep enable
    (SE) bit, and actually issuing the \c SLEEP instruction, are provided
    in the macros \c sleep_enable(), \c sleep_disable(), and
    \c sleep_cpu().  This also allows for test-and-sleep scenarios that
    take care of not missing the interrupt that will awake the device
    from sleep.

    Example:
    \code
    #include <avr/interrupt.h>
    #include <avr/sleep.h>

    ...
      set_sleep_mode(<mode>);
      cli();
      if (some_condition)
      {
        sleep_enable();
        sei();
        sleep_cpu();
        sleep_disable();
      }
      sei();
    \endcode

    This sequence ensures an atomic test of \c some_condition with
    interrupts being disabled.  If the condition is met, sleep mode
    will be prepared, and the \c SLEEP instruction will be scheduled
    immediately after an \c SEI instruction.  As the instruction right
    after the \c SEI is guaranteed to be executed before an interrupt
    could trigger, it is sure the device will really be put to sleep.

    Some devices have the ability to disable the Brown Out Detector (BOD) before
    going to sleep. This will also reduce power while sleeping. If the
    specific AVR device has this ability then an additional macro is defined:
    \c sleep_bod_disable(). This macro generates inlined assembly code
    that will correctly implement the timed sequence for disabling the BOD
    before sleeping. However, there is a limited number of cycles after the
    BOD has been disabled that the device can be put into sleep mode, otherwise
    the BOD will not truly be disabled. Recommended practice is to disable
    the BOD (\c sleep_bod_disable()), set the interrupts (\c sei()), and then
    put the device to sleep (\c sleep_cpu()), like so:

    \code
    #include <avr/interrupt.h>
    #include <avr/sleep.h>

    ...
      set_sleep_mode(<mode>);
      cli();
      if (some_condition)
      {
        sleep_enable();
        sleep_bod_disable();
        sei();
        sleep_cpu();
        sleep_disable();
      }
      sei();
    \endcode
