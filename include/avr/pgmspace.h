    \code
    #include <avr/io.h>
    #include <avr/pgmspace.h>
    \endcode

    The functions in this module provide interfaces for a program to access
    data stored in program space (flash memory) of the device.  In order to
    use these functions, the target device must support either the \c LPM or
    \c ELPM instructions.

    \note These functions are an attempt to provide some compatibility with
    header files that come with IAR C, to make porting applications between
    different compilers easier.  This is not 100% compatibility though (GCC
    does not have full support for multiple address spaces yet).

    \note If you are working with strings which are completely based in ram,
    use the standard string functions described in \ref avr_string.

    \note If possible, put your constant tables in the lower 64 KB and use
    pgm_read_byte_near() or pgm_read_word_near() instead of
    pgm_read_byte_far() or pgm_read_word_far() since it is more efficient that
    way, and you can still use the upper 64K for executable code.
    All functions that are suffixed with a \c _P \e require their
    arguments to be in the lower 64 KB of the flash ROM, as they do
    not use ELPM instructions.  This is normally not a big concern as
    the linker setup arranges any program space constants declared
    using the macros from this header file so they are placed right after
    the interrupt vectors, and in front of any executable code.  However,
    it can become a problem if there are too many of these constants, or
    for bootloaders on devices with more than 64 KB of ROM.
    <em>All these functions will not work in that situation.</em>

    \note For <b>Xmega</b> devices, make sure the NVM controller
    command register (\c NVM.CMD or \c NVM_CMD) is set to 0x00 (NOP)
    before using any of these functions.

   This macro facilitates the obtention of a 32 bit "far" pointer (only 24 bits
   used) to data even passed the 64KB limit for the 16 bit ordinary pointer. It
   is similar to the '&' operator, with some limitations.

   Comments:

   - The overhead is minimal and it's mainly due to the 32 bit size operation.

   - 24 bit sizes guarantees the code compatibility for use in future devices.

   - hh8() is an undocumented feature but seems to give the third significant byte
     of a 32 bit data and accepts symbols, complementing the functionality of hi8()
     and lo8(). There is not an equivalent assembler function to get the high
     significant byte.

   - 'var' has to be resolved at linking time as an existing symbol, i.e, a simple
     type variable name, an array name (not an indexed element of the array, if the
     index is a constant the compiler does not complain but fails to get the address
     if optimization is enabled), a struct name or a struct field name, a function
     identifier, a linker defined identifier,...

   - The returned value is the identifier's VMA (virtual memory address) determined
     by the linker and falls in the corresponding memory region. The AVR Harvard
     architecture requires non overlapping VMA areas for the multiple address spaces
     in the processor: Flash ROM, RAM, and EEPROM. Typical offset for this are
     0x00000000, 0x00800xx0, and 0x00810000 respectively, derived from the linker
     script used and linker options. The value returned can be seen then as a
     universal pointer.
