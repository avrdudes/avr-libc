As an extension, GNU C supports fixed-point types as defined in the
N1169 draft of ISO/IEC DTR 18037.

\since <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/changes.html#avr"
        >avr-gcc v4.8</a>

Two groups of fixed-point data types are added:
- The <em>fract types</em> and the <em>accum types</em>.
  The data value of a \e fract type has no integral part,
  hence values of a \e fract type are between -1.0 and +1.0.
- The value range of an \e accum type depends on the number of integral bits
  in the data type.

The following table helps with providing enough memory in \a buf.

Notice that the required size of \a buf is independent of #FXTOA_NTZ.
This is the case since with #FXTOA_NTZ the required buffer size may
be larger that the size of the returned string.
