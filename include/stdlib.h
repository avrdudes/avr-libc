   \brief Convert an unsigned integer to a string.

   The function utoa() converts the unsigned integer value from \c val into an
   ASCII representation that will be stored under \c s.  The caller
   is responsible for providing sufficient storage in \c s.

   \note The minimal size of the buffer \c s depends on the choice of
   radix. For example, if the radix is 2 (binary), you need to supply a buffer
   with a minimal length of 8 * sizeof (unsigned int) + 1 characters, i.e. one
   character for each bit plus one for the string terminator. Using a larger
   radix will require a smaller minimal buffer size.

   \warning If the buffer is too small, you risk a buffer overflow.

   Conversion is done using the \c radix as base, which may be a
   number between 2 (binary conversion) and up to 36.  If \c radix
   is greater than 10, the next digit after \c '9' will be the letter
   \c 'a'.

   The utoa() function returns the pointer passed as \c s.

   \note Decimal conversions can be sped up by using the uktoa() function from
   \ref avr_stdfix "<stdfix.h>" that converts fixed-point values to decimal
   ASCII, like in <code>uktoa((unsigned accum) val, s, FXTOA_TRUNC)</code>
   that converts \c val to a decimal ASCII representation with zero
   fractional digits.  For example, converting 1000 using utoa() takes
   around 700 cycles whereas uktoa() does the job in less than 300 cycles.

   \brief Convert an unsigned 64-bit integer to a string.

   The function ulltoa() writes the ASCII representation of
   the unsigned 64-bit integer \c val to a string starting at \c s.

   A very rough estimation of the execution time is

   {{{<i>Cycles</i> &asymp; 950 + 23*<i>N</i> + 8.3*<i>N</i><sup>2</sup>*log(<i>radix</i>) +/- 400}}}

   where <i>N</i> denotes the number of digits in the result,
   and \e log stands for the Natural Logarithm.
   This means a decimal conversion can take up to 9000 cycles,
   a hexadecimal conversions can take up to 7800 cycles,
   and a binary conversion can take more than 27000 cycles.

   \param val
   An unsigned 64-bit integral value for which the ASCII representation
   is computed.

   \param s
   The location to which the string representation should be stored.
   The caller is responsible for providing sufficient storage in \c s.
   The minimal size of the buffer \c s depends on the choice of the
   radix. For example, if the radix is 10 (decimal), the function will
   write at most 21 characters (including the terminating '\\0').

   \param radix
