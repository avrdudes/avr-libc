This file provides a Document Type Definition (DTD) for XML data files which
describe everything thing we need to generate the <avr/io*.h> header files.

Although ATMEL supplies XML device files already with AvrStudio >= 4.x, they
contain far more data than we need. In addition, there is information that we
need which they do not provide. Also, it may not be legal for us to include
those files with avr-libc.

I have written a python program (Atmel2libc.py) which will read ATMEL's XML
files and spit out a file which will validate against this DTD so that we can
leverage the data in those files. We will still have to manually add some data
to our generated xml files before we can use them to generate our headers.
