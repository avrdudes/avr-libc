 * Demo combining C and assembly source files.
 *
 * This demo implements an RC model type PWM decoder.  The incoming
 * PWM signal consists of a pulse sequence with a pulse width of 920
 * microseconds up to 2120 microseconds (1520 microseconds being the
 * neutral point).  Depending on the value of the decoded incoming
 * PWM, an outgoing PWM is controlled between 0 and 100 %.
 *
 * The project is intended to be run on an ATtiny13 that has only one
 * timer channel (timer 0), so both the incoming signal discrimination
 * as well as the outgoing PWM need to run on the same timer.
 *
 * For verification purposes, the same project can also be run on an
 * ATtiny25/45/85, where timer 1 can be used to evaluate the incoming
 * PWM signal, and timer 0 to generate the outgoing PWM.  In that
 * case, no additional assembly code is needed.
