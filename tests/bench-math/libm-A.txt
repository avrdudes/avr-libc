1The following tables contain benchmark values for some
1floating-point functions over the indicated range(s) of input values.

1Notice that the values for relative error and the Worst Case Execution Time
1Cycles<sub>max</sub> are only <em>lower bounds</em>.
1The best achievable accuracy for IEEE single with its 23 fractional bits in
1the mantissa is
1log<sub>10</sub>(2<sup>&ndash;24</sup> &asymp; 6&middot;10<sup>&ndash;8</sup>) &asymp; -7.22.

1The poor performance of \c sinf, \c cosf and \c tanf occurs for values
1that are close to the poles (if any) or close to the non-zero zeros.
