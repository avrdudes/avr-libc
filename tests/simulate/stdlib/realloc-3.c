 * variable-length records, forming a FIFO.  As the data arrive one
 * byte at a time, realloc() is used to extend the current record to
 * make the data fit.  Another semi-random part pulls data from the
 * FIFO head (again, one char at a time), and deletes the records
 * once they are completely processed.
 * After N (=2000) cycles, no more data are added to the FIFO, and
 * the remaining data are drained.
 * Finally, the number of characters "received" and "sent" is
 * compared, and must match, and the free list pointer is monitored
 * to ensure it only contains a single large block of all dynamic
 * memory that has been freed after use.
