# The ATmega128 simulations return an error code string in "external
# memory" at address 0x2000 upon failure.  If runtest.sh is run with
# option -s, it will abort the simulation, and leave the file
# core_avr_dump.core where this script can read the error code string
# from.  (The simulations on smaller AVRs don't generate this string
# in order to not bloat their code beyond the available ROM size by
# including sprintf().)

# If an argument is given to the script, it is used as the name of the
# simulavr core dump file to read.  Otherwise, the simulavr default
# name "core_avr_dump.core" is used.
