/** \defgroup demos Demo projects

  Various small demo projects are provided to illustrate several
  aspects of using the opensource utilities for the AVR controller
  series.  It should be kept in mind that these demos serve mainly
  educational purposes, and are normally not directly suitable for use
  in any production environment.  Usually, they have been kept as
  simple as sufficient to demonstrate one particular feature.

  The \ref demo_project "simple project" is somewhat like the "Hello
  world!"  application for a microcontroller, about the most simple
  project that can be done.  It is explained in good detail, to allow
  the reader to understand the basic concepts behind using the tools
  on an AVR microcontroller.

  The \ref largedemo "more sophisticated demo project" builds on top
  of that simple project, and adds some controls to it.  It touches
  a number of AVR-LibC's basic concepts on its way.

  A \ref stdiodemo "comprehensive example on using the standard IO facilities"
  intends to explain that complex topic, using a
  practical microcontroller peripheral setup with one RS-232
  connection, and an HD44780-compatible industry-standard LCD
  display.

  The \ref twi_demo project explains the use of the two-wire hardware
  interface (also known as "I2C") that is present on many AVR
  controllers.

  Finally, the \ref asmdemo demo shows how C and assembly language
  source files can collaborate within one project.  While the overall
  project is managed by a C program part for easy maintenance,
  time-critical parts are written directly in manually optimized
  assembly language for shortest execution times possible.  Naturally,
  this kind of project is very closely tied to the hardware design,
  thus it is custom-tailored to a particular controller type and
  peripheral setup.  As an alternative to the assembly-language
  solution, this project also offers a C-only implementation
  (deploying the exact same peripheral setup) based on a more
  sophisticated (and thus more expensive) but pin-compatible
  controller.

  While the simple demo is meant to run on about any AVR setup
  possible where a LED could be connected to the OCR1[A] output,
  the \ref largedemo "large" and \ref stdiodemo "stdio" demos are
  mainly targeted to the Atmel STK500 starter kit, and the
  \ref twi_demo "TWI" example requires a controller where some
  24Cxx two-wire EEPPROM can be connected to.  For the STK500
  demos, the default CPU (either an AT90S8515 or an ATmega8515)
  should be removed from its socket, and the ATmega16 that ships
  with the kit should be inserted into socket SCKT3100A3.  The
  ATmega16 offers an on-board ADC that is used in the
  \ref largedemo "large" demo, and all AVRs with an ADC feature
  a different pinout than the industry-standard compatible
  devices.

  In order to fully utilize the \ref largedemo "large" demo, a
  female 10-pin header with cable, connecting to a 10 kOhm
  potentiometer will be useful.

  For the \ref stdiodemo "stdio" demo, an industry-standard
  HD44780-compatible LCD display of at least 16x1 characters
  will be needed.  Among other things, the
  <a href="http://ssl.bulix.org/projects/lcd4linux/">LCD4Linux</a>
  project page describes many things around these displays,
  including common pinouts.
