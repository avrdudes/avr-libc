TODO for avr-libc:

 - fix signed/unsigned gcc warnings (qsort.c, strtol.c, strtoul.c)
     [Joerg has patch [1] for this that just needs some love before it's
     committed.]
 - finish porting newlib to AVR (may be useful especially for
   larger devices, and for testing avr-gcc itself...)
 - optimize strlcpy and strlcat
     [Eric Weddington has submitted a patch [2] with optimized versions.
	 Needs review/testing before commit.]
 - Fix asin(). Seems to be rather inaccurate for small numbers.
 - Add API for sleep instruction.
 - Document how to pre-program the EEPROM.
 - Write for avr-libc [3] : stddef.h, sys/types.h, limits.h,
   sys/systemcfg.h?, stdio.h?
 - Figure out how to remove __ prefix from function args in dox.
 - Doxument the following:
   * interfaces in:
     + include/math.h
     + include/avr/crc16.h  ???
     + include/avr/delay.h  ???
     + include/avr/ina90.h  ???
     + include/avr/timer.h  ???
     + include/avr/twi.h (move to examples?)
     + include/avr/wdt.h (move to examples?)
     + include/avr/parity.h (move to examples?)
   * the mechanism behind include/avr/io*.h ???
   * merge chapter 3 from Rich Neswold's doc. Needs some rewriting to
     update for newer tools. (explanation of start code)
   * gcrt1.S
   * introduction
 - testsuite [4]
