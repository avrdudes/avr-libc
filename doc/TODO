TODO for avr-libc:

Before 1.4:
    - Move the following to examples
        * include/avr/parity.h
    - Document:
        * merge chapter 3 from Rich Neswold's doc. Needs some rewriting to
          update for newer tools. (explanation of start code)
        * gcrt1.S
        * how to pre-program the EEPROM.
        * how to roll your own crt*.o
    - Document Windows Build guide.

    - Figure out how to remove __ prefix from function args in dox.
      [Ted has workaround [5].]
    - fix signed/unsigned gcc warnings (qsort.c, strtol.c, strtoul.c)
      [Joerg has patch [1] for this that just needs some love before it's
      committed.]
    - Write for avr-libc [3] : stddef.h, sys/types.h, limits.h,
      sys/systemcfg.h?
    - testsuite [4]
    - Add <compat/io.h>: smallest common denominator for IO port
      declarations. [7]
    - Hunt down and fix broken links in html dox. Linklint is a useful tool
      for that. [http://www.linklint.org/]
    - Convert build system to use autoconf-2.57 and automake-1.7.7. Some
      discussion has occurred. [8]
