TODO for avr-libc:

 - fix signed/unsigned gcc warnings (qsort.c, strtol.c, strtoul.c)
     [Joerg has patch [1] for this that just needs some love before it's
     committed.]
 - finish porting newlib to AVR (may be useful especially for
   larger devices, and for testing avr-gcc itself...)
 - optimize strlcpy and strlcat
     [Eric Weddington has submitted a patch [2] with optimized versions.
	 Needs review/testing before commit.]
 - Document how to pre-program the EEPROM.
 - Write for avr-libc [3] : stddef.h, sys/types.h, limits.h,
   sys/systemcfg.h?, stdio.h?
 - Figure out how to remove __ prefix from function args in dox.
