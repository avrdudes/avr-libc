TODO for AVR-LibC:

Before 1.8:
    - Document:
        * merge chapter 3 from Rich Neswold's doc. Needs some rewriting to
          update for newer tools. (explanation of start code)
        * gcrt1.S
        * how to pre-program the EEPROM.
        * how to roll your own crt*.o

    - Figure out how to remove __ prefix from function args in dox.
      [Ted has workaround [5].]
    - fix signed/unsigned gcc warnings (qsort.c).
      [Joerg has patch [1] for this that just needs some love before it's
      committed.]
    - Write for AVR-LibC [3] : stddef.h, sys/types.h, limits.h,
      sys/systemcfg.h?
    - Add <compat/io.h>: smallest common denominator for IO port
      declarations. [7]
    - Hunt down and fix broken links in html dox. Linklint is a useful tool
      for that. [http://www.linklint.org/]
