\section install_unix Building and Installing under Linux, FreeBSD, and Others

The default behaviour for most of these tools is to install every thing under
the \c /usr/local directory.  In order to keep the AVR tools separate from the
base system, it is usually better to install everything into
<tt>/usr/local/avr</tt>.  If the \c /usr/local/avr directory does not exist,
you should create it before trying to install anything.  You will need
\c root access to install there.  If you don't have or want root access to the
system, you can alternatively install in your home directory, for example, in
<tt>$HOME/local/avr</tt>.  Where you install is a completely arbitrary
decision, but should be consistent for all the tools.

\warning If you have \c CC set to anything other than \c avr-gcc in your
environment, this will cause the configure script to fail. It is best to not
have \c CC set at all.

\note It is usually the best to use the latest released version of
each of the tools.


\subsection install_preparations Preparations

\subsubsection install_location Install Location

You specify the installation directory by using the <tt>\--prefix=dir</tt>
option with the \c configure script.  It is important to install all the AVR
tools in the same directory or some of the tools will not work correctly.  To
ensure consistency and simplify the discussion, we will use \c $PREFIX to
refer to whatever directory you wish to install in.  You can set this as an
environment variable if you wish as such (using a Bourne-like shell):

\addindex $PREFIX
\addindex --prefix
\verbatim
$ PREFIX=$HOME/local/avr
$ export PREFIX
\endverbatim

\addindex $PATH
\anchor path \note Be sure that you have your \c PATH environment variable set
to search the directory you install everything in \e before you start
installing anything.  For example, if you use <tt>\--prefix=$PREFIX</tt>, you
must have \c $PREFIX/bin in your exported \c PATH. As such:

\verbatim
$ PATH=$PATH:$PREFIX/bin
$ export PATH
\endverbatim

\subsubsection install_dir_layout Directory Layout

The instructions below build Binutils, GCC and AVR-LibC \e outside of the
source tree, because:

- When something goes wrong, you can just remove the build directory and
  start all over again with a fresh build folder.
- You may want to build the tools with different configure options, e.g.
  build the tools for a Linux host and then build a
  \ref install_canadian "Canadian cross" to run on a Windows host.
- GCC does not support configuring anywhere in the source tree, so we'll
  have to use a separate build folder outside the source tree, anyway.

The instructions below assume that you have set up a directory tree like
\verbatim
+--source
+--build
\endverbatim
in some place where you have write access, like in your home directory.

After successful downloads and builds, the tree will be something like:
\verbatim
+--source
|   +--gcc-<version>
|   +--binutils-<version>
|   +--avr-libc-<version>
+-- build
    +--gcc-<version>-avr
    +--binutils-<version>-avr
    +--avr-libc-<version>
\endverbatim

\subsection install_avr_binutils GNU Binutils for the AVR target
\addindex installation, binutils

The \b Binutils package provides all the low-level utilities
needed in building and manipulating object files.  Once installed, your
environment will have an
AVR assembler (<tt>\ref using_avr_as "avr-as"</tt>),
linker (<tt>\ref using_avr_ld "avr-ld"</tt>),
and librarian (\c avr-ar and \c avr-ranlib).
In addition, you get tools which extract data from object files
(\c avr-objcopy), dissassemble object file information
(\c avr-objdump), and strip information from object files
(\c avr-strip).  Before we can build the C compiler, these tools need to
be in place.

Download and unpack the source files:

\verbatim
$ # in ./source
$ tar xfj binutils-<version>.tar.bz2
\endverbatim

Replace \c &lt;version&gt; with the version of the package you downloaded.

If you obtained a gzip compressed file (\c \.tar\.gz or \.tgz),
use <tt>gunzip</tt> instead of <tt>bunzip2</tt>, or
<tt>tar xfz <em>file</em>.tar.gz</tt>.

The next step is to configure and build the tools. This is done by supplying
arguments to the <tt>configure</tt> script that enable the AVR-specific
options.  When you also want GDB, just drop <tt>\--disable-gdb</tt>.

\verbatim
$ # in ./build
$ mkdir binutils-<version>-avr
$ cd binutils-<version>-avr
$ ../../source/binutils-<version>/configure --prefix=$PREFIX --target=avr \
    --disable-nls --disable-sim --disable-gdb --disable-werror
\endverbatim

When <tt>configure</tt> is run, it generates a lot of messages while it
determines what is available on your operating system. When it finishes, it
will have created several <tt>Makefile</tt>s that are custom tailored to your
platform and that are run with the \c make command.

\verbatim
$ make
\endverbatim

\note BSD users should note that the project's <tt>Makefile</tt> uses GNU
make syntax. This means FreeBSD users may need to build the tools by
using <tt>gmake</tt>.

If the tools compiled cleanly, you're ready to install them. If you specified
a destination that isn't owned by your account, you'll need <tt>root</tt>
access to install them. To install:

\verbatim
$ make install
\endverbatim

You should now have the programs from Binutils installed into
<tt>$PREFIX/bin</tt>.  Don't forget to \ref path "set your PATH" environment
variable before going to build avr-gcc.
To check that the correct assembler is found, run
\verbatim
$ avr-as --version
\endverbatim
which should print the <tt>&lt;version&gt;</tt> of the used Binutils sources.


\subsection install_avr_gcc GCC for the AVR target
\addindex installation, gcc

\warning You \b must install
\ref install_avr_binutils "avr-binutils" and make sure your
\ref path "path is set" properly before installing avr-gcc.

Before we can configure the compiler, we have to prepare the sources.
GCC depends on some external host libraries, namely
<a href="https://gmplib.org">GMP</a>,
<a href="https://www.mpfr.org">MPFR</a>,
<a href="https://www.multiprecision.org">MPC</a> and
<a href="https://libisl.sourceforge.io">ISL</a>.
You can build and install the appropriate versions of the required
prerequisites by hand and provide their location by means
of <tt>\--with-gmp=</tt> etc.
Though in most situations it is easier to let GCC download and
build these libraries as part of the configure and build process.
All what's needed is an internet connection when
running \c \./contrib/download_prerequisites:

\verbatim
$ # in ./source
$ tar xfj gcc-<version>.tar.bz2
$ cd gcc-<version>
$ ./contrib/download_prerequisites

$ # in ./build
$ mkdir gcc-<version>-avr
$ cd gcc-<version>-avr
$ ../../source/gcc-<version>/configure --prefix=$PREFIX --target=avr --enable-languages=c,c++ \
    --disable-nls --disable-libssp --disable-libcc1 \
    --with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld --with-dwarf2
$ make
$ make install # or make install-strip
\endverbatim

The GCC binaries may consume quite some disc space.  In most cases, you
don't need the debug information in the compiler proper, and installing with
\verbatim
$ make install-strip
\endverbatim
can save you some space.


\subsection install_avr_libc AVR LibC
\addindex installation, avr-libc

\warning You \b must install
\ref install_avr_binutils "avr-binutils",
\ref install_avr_gcc "avr-gcc" and make sure your
\ref path "path is set" properly before installing avr-libc.

\note If you have obtained the latest AVR-LibC from \ref using_git "git",
you will have to run the \c \./bootstrap script before using either of the
build methods described below.

To build and install AVR-LibC:

\verbatim
$ # in ./source
$ tar xfz avr-libc-<version>.tar.gz

$ # in ./build
$ mkdir avr-libc-<version>
$ cd avr-libc-<version>
$ ../../source/avr-libc-<version>/configure --prefix=$PREFIX \
    --build=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu --host=avr
$ make
$ make install
\endverbatim

Where the \c \--build platform can be guessed by running
\verbatim
$ ./source/avr-libc-<version>/config.guess
\endverbatim


\subsection install_avrprog AVRDUDE
\addindex installation, avrprog
\addindex installation, avrdude

\note It has been ported to windows (via MinGW or cygwin), Linux and Solaris. Other Unix systems
should be trivial to port to.

<tt><b>avrdude</b></tt> is part of the FreeBSD ports system. To install it,
simply do the following:

\verbatim
# cd /usr/ports/devel/avrdude
# make install
\endverbatim

\note Installation into the default location usually requires root
permissions.  However, running the program only requires access
permissions to the appropriate \c ppi(4) device.

Building and installing on other systems should use the \c configure system,
as such:

\verbatim
$ gunzip -c avrdude-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd avrdude-<version>
$ mkdir obj-avr
$ cd obj-avr
$ ../configure --prefix=$PREFIX
$ make
$ make install
\endverbatim


\subsection install_simulavr SimulAVR
\addindex installation, simulavr

SimulAVR also uses the \c configure system, so to build and install:

\verbatim
$ gunzip -c simulavr-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd simulavr-<version>
$ mkdir obj-avr
$ cd obj-avr
$ ../configure --prefix=$PREFIX
$ make
$ make install
\endverbatim

\note You might want to have already installed
\ref install_avr_binutils "avr-binutils",
\ref install_avr_gcc "avr-gcc" and
\ref install_avr_libc "avr-libc"
if you want to have the test programs built in the simulavr source.



\subsection install_avarice AVaRICE
\addindex installation, avarice

\note These install notes are not applicable to avarice-1.5 or older. You
probably don't want to use anything that old anyways since there have been
many improvements and bug fixes since the 1.5 release.

AVaRICE also uses the \c configure system, so to build and install:

\verbatim
$ gunzip -c avarice-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -
$ cd avarice-<version>
$ mkdir obj-avr
$ cd obj-avr
$ ../configure --prefix=$PREFIX
$ make
$ make install
\endverbatim

\note AVaRICE uses the BFD library for accessing various binary file formats.
You may need to tell the configure script where to find the lib and headers
for the link to work. This is usually done by invoking the configure script
like this (Replace <tt>\<hdr_path\></tt> with the path to the \c bfd.h file on
your system. Replace <tt>\<lib_path\></tt> with the path to \c libbfd.a on your
system.):

\verbatim
$ CPPFLAGS=-I<hdr_path> LDFLAGS=-L<lib_path> ../configure --prefix=$PREFIX
\endverbatim



\section install_windows Building and Installing under Windows

Building and installing the toolchain under Windows requires more effort because
all of the tools required for building, and the programs themselves, are mainly
designed for running under a POSIX environment such as Unix and Linux. Windows
does not natively provide such an environment.

There are two projects available that provide such an environment, Cygwin and
MinGW. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Cygwin provides a
very complete POSIX environment that allows one to build many Linux based tools
from source with very little or no source modifications. However, POSIX
functionality is provided in the form of a DLL that is linked to the application.
This DLL has to be redistributed with your application and there are issues if
the Cygwin DLL already exists on the installation system and different versions
of the DLL. On the other hand, MinGW can compile code as native Win32
applications. However, this means that programs designed for Unix and Linux (i.e.
that use POSIX functionality) will not compile as MinGW does not provide
that POSIX layer for you. Therefore most programs that compile on both types of
host systems, usually must provide some sort of abstraction layer to allow an
application to be built cross-platform.

MinGW does provide somewhat of a POSIX environment, called MSYS, that
allows you to build Unix and Linux applications as they would normally do,
with a \c configure
step and a \c make step. Cygwin also provides such an environment. This means
that building the AVR toolchain is very similar to how it is built in Linux,
described above. The main differences are in what the PATH environment variable
gets set to, pathname differences, and the tools that are required to build the
projects under Windows. We'll take a look at the tools next.


\subsection install_windows_tools Tools Required for Building the Toolchain for Windows

These are the tools that are currently used to build an AVR tool chain.
This list may change, either the version of the tools, or the tools themselves,
as improvements are made.

<dl>
<dt>MinGW</dt>
<dd>
  Download the MinGW Automated Installer, 2013-10-04 (or later)
  <https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files>
  - Run <tt>mingw-get-setup.exe</tt>
  - In the installation wizard, keep the default values and press
    the "Next" button for all installer pages except for the pages
    explicitly listed below.
  - In the installer page "Repository Catalogues", select the "Download latest
    repository catalogues" radio button, and press the "Next" button
  - In the installer page "License Agreement", select the "I accept
    the agreement" radio button, and press the "Next" button
  - In the installer page "Select Components", be sure to select these items:
    - C compiler (default checked)
    - C++ compiler
    - Ada compiler
    - MinGW Developer Toolkit (which includes "MSYS Basic System").
  - Install.
</dd>

<dt>Install Cygwin</dt>
<dd>
  Install everything, all users, UNIX line endings. This will take a
  \e long time.  A fat internet pipe is highly recommended.
  It is also recommended that you download all to a directory first,
  and then install from that directory to your machine.
</dd>
</dl>

\note GMP, MPFR, MPC and ISL are required to build GCC. By far the easiest way
to use them is by letting GCC download the sources locally by means of
running the \c \./contrib/download_prewrequisites script from the
GCC top source.  GCC will configure and build these libs during
\c configure and \c make.

\note Doxygen is required to build AVR-LibC documentation.
- <b>Install Doxygen</b><br>
    - Version 1.7.2
    - <https://www.doxygen.nl>
    - Download and install.

\note NetPBM is required to build graphics in the AVR-LibC documentation.
- <b>Install NetPBM</b><br>
    - Version 10.27.0
    - From the GNUWin32 project: <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html>
    - Download and install.

\note fig2dev is required to build graphics in the AVR-LibC documentation.
- <b>Install fig2dev</b><br>
    - Version 3.2 patchlevel 5c
    - From WinFig 4.62: <http://winfig.com/downloads>
    - Download the zip file version of WinFig
    - Unzip the download file and install fig2dev.exe in a location of your
    choice, somewhere in the PATH.
    - You may have to unzip and install related DLL files for fig2dev. In the
    version above, you have to install QtCore4.dll and QtGui4.dll.

\note MikTeX is required to build various documentation.
- <b>Install MiKTeX</b><br>
    - Version 2.9
    - <https://miktex.org>
    - Download and install.

\note Ghostscript is required to build various documentation.
- <b>Install Ghostscript</b><br>
    - Version 9.00
    - <https://www.ghostscript.com>
    - Download and install.
    - In the \\bin subdirectory of the installaion, copy gswin32c.exe to gs.exe.

- Set the \c TEMP and \c TMP environment variables to <b><tt>c:\\\\temp</tt></b>
  or to the
  short filename version. This helps to avoid NTVDM errors during building.


\subsection install_windows_building Building the Toolchain for Windows

All directories in the PATH environment variable should be specified using
their short filename (8.3) version. This will also help to avoid NTVDM errors
during building. These short filenames can be specific to each machine.

\section install_canadian Canadian Cross Builds

It is also possible to build avr-gcc for host Windows on a Linux build system.
Suppose you have installed a
<a href="https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads"><tt>i686-w64-mingw32-gcc</tt></a>
toolchain that can compile code to run on <tt>host=i686-w64-mingw32</tt>.
Then the steps to build a toolchain for Windows are:

-# Build and install the AVR toolchain for the Linux build machine
as explained above.  Make sure that running the command
\verbatim
avr-gcc --version
\endverbatim
prints the compiler version according to the used GCC sources.
The native AVR cross compiler is required during configure and to build
the AVR target libraries like libgcc.
Similarly, the version of the found AVR Binutils programs must
match the version of the used Binutils sources.

-# Determine the name of the \c \--build platform like \c x86_64-pc-linux-gnu,
for example by running the \c config\.guess script as shipped with the
top level GCC sources (and also with Binutils sources,
and AVR-LibC sources after \c \./bootstrap).

-# Use different build and install directories, e.g.
<tt>./build/binutils-&lt;version&gt;-avr-mingw32</tt> to build Binutils
and <tt>\--prefix=$PREFIX-mingw32</tt> as install path.

-# Configure, build and install  <b>Binutils</b> and <b>GCC</b> like for
the native build, but add the following configure options:
\verbatim
--build=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu --host=i686-w64-mingw32
\endverbatim
This assumes that the required host libraries like GMP are being built
in one go with the compiler. This is accomplished by running the
<tt>contrib/download_prerequisites</tt> script from the toplevel GCC sources,
just like with the native build.

-# There is no need to build <b>AVR-LibC</b> again because it is a pure target
library. It can be installed by means of running
\verbatim
$ # in ./build/avr-libc-<version>
$ make install prefix=$PREFIX-mingw32
\endverbatim

In order to "install" the toolchain on Windows, the canadian cross installed
in <tt>$PREFIX-mingw32</tt> can be moved to the desired location on the
Windows computer.  The compiler can be used by calling it by its absolute
path, or by adding the <tt>$PREFIX-mingw32/bin</tt> directory to
the \c PATH environment variable.

\section using_git Using Git

Most of the sources of the projects above are now managed with the
<a href="https://git-scm.com">git</a>
distributed version-control tools.  When you want to build from the
newest development branch, you can clone the repo, like with
\verbatim
$ git clone <repo> [dirname]
\endverbatim
Replace <tt>&lt;repo&gt;</tt> with the URL of the Git repository, e.g.
<tt>%https://github.com/avrdudes/avr-libc.git</tt> for AVR-LibC.
Notice that when building AVR-LibC from the repo source, you have to run
<tt>./bootstrap</tt> from the top level AVR-LibC sources prior to
\c configure.

Useful options for git clone:

<dl>
<dt><tt>dirname</tt></dt>
<dd>
  Specify an optional directory name for the cloned repository, like:
  \verbatim
$ git clone https://github.com/avrdudes/avr-libc.git ./source/avr-libc-master
  \endverbatim
  Without \c dirname, the name of the git file like \c avr-libc is used.
</dd>

<dt><tt>\--depth 1</tt></dt>
<dd>
  An ordinary clone will clone the complete repository with all its branches
  and their history.  To speed up the cloning and save some disc space,
  you can just clone the top of the history to some depth.
</dd>

<dt><tt>\--branch <em>branch</em></tt></dt>
<dd>
  The default branch is the head of the latest development, which is
  \c master for GCC and Binutils, and \c root for AVR-LibC.

  When you want a different ref, like GCC's <tt>releases/gcc-14</tt>
  for the head of the GCC v14 branch, or <tt>releases/gcc-14.1.0</tt>
  for the GCC v14.1 release tag, then you can specify that as
  <tt><em>branch</em></tt>. To see the available refs, you can use
  \verbatim
$ git ls-remote <repo>
  \endverbatim
</dd>
</dl>
