/** \page benchmarks Benchmarks

- \ref bench_libc "Benchmarks for libc functions"
- \ref bench_libm "Benchmarks for IEEE single floating-point functions" from \ref avr_math "<math.h>"
- \ref bench_libf7 "Benchmarks for IEEE double floating-point functions" from \ref avr_math "<math.h>"
- \ref bench_fxlib "Benchmarks for fixed-point functions" from \ref avr_stdfix "<stdfix.h>"

The results below can only give a rough estimate of the resources
necessary for using certain library functions. There is a number
of factors which can both increase or reduce the effort required:

- Expenses for preparation of operands and their stack are not
considered.

- In the table, the size includes all dependent functions.

- Expenses of time of performance of some functions essentially depend
on parameters of a call, for example, qsort() is recursive, and sprintf()
receives parameters in a stack.

- Different versions of the compiler can give a significant difference in
code size and execution time. For example, the dtostre() function, compiled
with avr-gcc 3.4.6, requires 930 bytes. After transition to avr-gcc 4.2.3,
the size become 1088 bytes.
