\section avr_libc_intro Introduction

The latest version of this document is always available from
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/avr-libc/

The AVR Libc package provides a subset of the standard C library for
<a href="http://www.atmel.com/products/AVR/">Atmel AVR
8-bit RISC microcontrollers</a>. In addition, the library provides the basic
startup code needed by most applications.

There is a wealth of information in this document which goes beyond simply
describing the interfaces and routines provided by the library. We hope that
this document provides enough information to get a new AVR developer up to
speed quickly using the freely available development tools: binutils, gcc
avr-libc and many others.

If you find yourself stuck on a problem which this document doesn't quite
address, you may wish to post a message to the avr-gcc mailing list. Most of
the developers of the AVR binutils and gcc ports in addition to the devleopers
of avr-libc subscribe to the list, so you will usually be able to get your
problem resolved. You can subscribe to the list at
http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/avr-gcc-list . Before posting to the
list, you might want to try reading the \ref FAQ chapter of this document.

\note If you think you've found a bug, or have a suggestion for an
improvement, either in this documentation or in the library itself,
please use the bug tracker at
https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=avr-libc to ensure the issue
won't be forgotten.

\section avr_libc_general General information about this library

In general, it has been the goal to stick as best as possible to
established standards while implementing this library.  Commonly, this
refers to the C library as described by the ANSI X3.159-1989 and
ISO/IEC 9899:1990 ("ANSI-C") standard, as well as parts of their
successor ISO/IEC 9899:1999 ("C99").  Some additions have been
inspired by other standards like IEEE Std 1003.1-1988 ("POSIX.1"),
while other extensions are purely AVR-specific (like the entire
program-space string interface).

Unless otherwise noted, functions of this library are <em>not</em>
guaranteed to be reentrant.  In particular, any functions that store
local state are known to be non-reentrant, as well as functions that
manipulate IO registers like the EEPROM access routines.  If these
functions are used within both standard and interrupt contexts
undefined behaviour will result.


\section supp_devices Supported Devices

\addindex supported devices

The following is a list of AVR devices currently supported by the library.

of the compiler/assembler to support these devices at library
compile-time.

\anchor supp_dev_footnote_one

\note <b>[1]</b> Assembly only. There is no direct support for these devices to be
programmed in C since they do not have a RAM based stack.  Still, it could be
possible to program them in C, see the \ref faq_tinyavr_c "FAQ" for an option.

\anchor supp_dev_footnote_two

\note <b>[2]</b> The at94K devices are a combination of FPGA and AVR
microcontroller. [TRoth-2002/11/12: Not sure of the level of support for
these. More information would be welcomed.]

\anchor supp_dev_footnote_three

\note <b>[3]</b> The at76c711 is a USB to fast serial interface bridge chip
using an AVR core.
