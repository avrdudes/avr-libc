/** \page acks Acknowledgments

    This document tries to tie together the labors of a large group of
    people. Without these individuals' efforts, we wouldn't have a terrific,
    <i><b>free</b></i> set of tools to develop AVR projects. We all owe thanks
    to:

	- The GCC Team, which produced a very capable set of development tools for
	an amazing number of platforms and processors.

	- Denis Chertykov [ denisc@overta.ru ] for making the AVR-specific changes
	to the GNU tools.

	- Denis Chertykov and Marek Michalkiewicz [ marekm@linux.org.pl ] for
	developing the standard libraries and startup code for \b AVR-GCC.

	- Uros Platise for developing the AVR programmer tool, \b uisp.

	- Joerg Wunsch [ joerg@FreeBSD.ORG ] for adding all the AVR development
	tools to the FreeBSD [ http://www.freebsd.org ] ports tree and for
	providing the basics for the \ref demo_project "demo project".

	- Brian Dean [ bsd@bsdhome.com ] for developing \b avrdude (an alternative
	to <b>uisp</b>) and for contributing \ref using_avrprog "documentation"
	which describes how to use it. \b Avrdude was previously called 
	\b avrprog.

	- Eric Weddington [ eweddington@cso.atmel.com ] for maintaining the \b WinAVR
	package and thus making the continued improvements to the
	open source AVR toolchain available to many users.

	- Rich Neswold for writing the original avr-tools document (which he
	graciously allowed to be merged into this document) and his
	improvements to the \ref demo_project "demo project".

	- Theodore A. Roth for having been a long-time maintainer of
	many of the tools (\b AVR-LibC, the AVR port of \b GDB, \b AVaRICE,
	\b uisp, \b avrdude).

	- All the people who currently maintain the tools, and/or
	have submitted suggestions, patches and bug reports.
    (See the AUTHORS files of the various tools.)

	- And lastly, all the users who use the software. If nobody used the
	software, we would probably not be very motivated to continue to develop
	it. Keep those bug reports coming. ;-)
