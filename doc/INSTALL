Installation instructions:

https://avrdudes.github.io/avr-libc/avr-libc-user-manual/install_tools.html

0. Always use AVR-LibC with the Binutils and GCC versions for which is
   has been configured and built.

1. Build and install the current version of binutils for the AVR target.
   Releases older than 2.26 are not supported.

   $ .../configure --target=avr

   See https://sourceware.org/binutils/

2. Build and install the desired version of GCC for the AVR target.
   Releases older than GCC 4.8 are not supported.

   $ .../configure --target=avr --enable-languages=c,c++

   Note that configuring GCC anywhere in the source tree is not supported,
   and that GCC needs some prerequisite host libraries like GMP, MPFR, etc.
   See https://gcc.gnu.org/install/

3. Now you can build and install AVR-LibC:
   Make sure that the avr-gcc compiler and AVR Binutils are in the PATH.
   Then run

   $ .../configure --build=`./config.guess` --host=avr && make

   Then (as root, or user with write permissions to the installation directory)

   $ make install

   Note that GNU make is required, so if GNU make is installed under a
   different name on your system (e.g. gmake), change that appropriately above.

By default, everything is installed under /usr/local.
You can change that if you configure with --prefix=/location or install with

$ make install prefix=/location

Run

$ ./configure --help

to see more configure options.  If you obtained AVR-LibC sources directly
from GIT, you will need to run

$ ./bootstrap

at toplevel AVR-LibC sources before configuring.  Use recent versions of
autoconf and automake.  Running bootstrap requires Python 2.6 or newer.
