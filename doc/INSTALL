Installation instructions:

1. Build and install the current released version of binutils, version 2.16
   (releases older than 2.13 are not supported), for AVR target
   (configure --target=avr).  See http://sources.redhat.com/binutils/ .

2. Build and install the current released version of GCC, version 3.4.4
   (older releases older than 3.3 are not supported), for AVR target
   (configure --target=avr --enable-languages=c,c++).  C++ support is
   still experimental and incomplete (no libstdc++), and needs testing.

3. Now you can build and install AVR-LibC - type

   ./configure --build=`./config.guess` --host=avr && make

   then (as root, or user with write permissions to the installation
   directory)

   make install

   Note that GNU make is required, so if GNU make is installed under a
   different name on your system (e.g. gmake), change that
   appropriately above.

By default, everything is installed under /usr/local - you can change
that if you execute ./configure ... --prefix=/location. There are
other configure options if you like.  Type "./configure --help" to see
them.

Note: If you obtained AVR-LibC directly from cvs, you will need to run
the bootstrap script.  Be sure to use recent versions of autoconf and
automake.  automake version 1.7 and autoconf version 2.57 or above are
required (1.9, and 2.59 resp. are recommended).
