*** Changes since avr-libc-1.2.5:

* Major API changes:

  - The INTERRUPT() macro has been deprecated, and it will be
    removed in a future version.  Use __attribute__((interrupt))
    explicitly if this functionality is really needed.

  - The standard IO facilities API has been enhanced

    . The backend functions put and get that are passed to fdevopen()
      during the setup of a stream now take the stream itself as an
      additional argument.
      By defining the macro __STDIO_FDEVOPEN_COMPAT_12 before
      including <stdio.h>, an fdevopen() function prototype will be
      declared that is backwards-compatible with avr-libc version
      1.2 and before.
    . It is possible to tie user data to a stream using
      fdev_set_udata(), and to retrieve them using fdev_get_udata().
      Together with the additional argument to the backend functions,
      these functions can now e.g. keep track of internal user state,
      or distinguish two different devices using the same backend
      function.
    . The get backend function can now return _FDEV_EOF to indicate an
      end-of-file condition, in addition to _FDEV_ERR for an error
      condition.  This will affect the internal state that can be
      queried using the standard feof() and ferror() functions.
    . A new macro fdev_setup_stream() is provided to setup a
      user-supplied stream without the need to call fdevopen(), and thus
      without requiring malloc().  A similar macro FDEV_SETUP_STREAM()
      exists that can be used to initialized a FILE object.  The
      floating-point implementations of vfscanf() and vfprintf() now
      allocate their conversion buffer on the stack, so they do not need
      malloc() anymore either.

  - Update the build system to recent versions of autoconf/automake;
    the old "doconf" and "domake" scripts are gone now, "reconf" has
    been renamed to "bootstrap".
  - Update the documentation system to doxygen >= 1.4.1.
  - Major overhaul of the documentation, new layout of the HTML pages,
    several clarifications and additions.
  - Add support for the following new devices (depending on the ability
    of the compiler/binutils to handle them):

program memory

The %S format can now be used to print strings that are located in
program-space memory (aka. ROM).

which is similar to strnlen() except that it takes a pointer to a
program-space string.

  [#8452] some SFR and bit names in iom169.h are incorrect
          NOTE: Where possible, the old names are retained to avoid breaking
          existing code, but the OCR1A and OCR1B names where just plain wrong
          so they have been changed and the incorrect names (OCRA1 and OCRB1)
          are undefined.

* Remove deprecated items:
  + obsolete headers from the base include directory (moved to the avr/
    subdirectory long ago)
  + deprecated macros and functions from
    . <avr/eeprom.h> (eeprom_rb, eeprom_rw, eeprom_wb),
    . <avr/io.h>  (cbi, sbi, inb, outb, inw, outw, inp, outp, BV),
    . <avr/pgmspace.h> (PRG_RDB).
  + . <avr/timer.h> removed completely.

* Moved header files:

  + <avr/ina90.h> moved to <compat/ina90.h>
  + <avr/twi.h> moved to <compat/twi.h>

* New devices supported:

  + ATmega165
  + ATmega325
  + ATmega3250
  + ATmega645
  + ATmega6450
  + ATmega48
  + ATmega88
  + ATmega168
  + ATtiny13
  + ATtiny2313
  + AT90CAN128

* Pin names for ports are now consistent for all devices.

* dtostrf() now uses movw where possible

* realloc() has been implemented.

* Extend pgmspace API.

The pgmspace API has had the following macros added to allow accessing of
unsigned 32-bit values:

  pgm_read_dword_near
  pgm_read_dword_far
  pgm_read_dword

* Change boot API.

The boot API internals have changed such that it is not compatible with the
1.0.x API.

These macros have been changed so that they no longer wait for SPM and EEPROM
operations to complete. It turns out that doing those checks all the time is
not needed and tends to bloat the code. Removing the checks allows you to
write more compact code (see the example in avr/boot.h).

  boot_page_fill
  boot_page_erase
  boot_page_write
  boot_rww_enable
  boot_lock_bits_set

If you want the old behaviour (1.0.x compatible), use these new macros:

  boot_page_fill_safe
  boot_page_erase_safe
  boot_page_write_safe
  boot_rww_enable_safe
  boot_lock_bits_set_safe

* Extend eeprom API.

New macro:
  eeprom_busy_wait

* Extend crc16 API.

New functions:
  _crc_xmodem_update
  _crc_ccitt_update

* Extend stdio API.

New functions:
  vfprintf_P
  vfscanf_P
  vsprintf
  vsprintf_P
  vsnprintf
  vsnprintf_P

* Extend malloc API.

Implement realloc().

* Extend delay API (<avr/delay.h>).

Implement inline functions for specifying delays in microseconds, or
milliseconds directly (based on the macro F_CPU specifying the CPU
clock frequency).

* Documentation changes:

  + Use newer Doxygen.
  + Many fixes and added documentation.
  + Unix-style man pages are generated now when doc generation has been
    enabled in ./configure

* Optimize slightly strtol and strtoul functions.

* Unified copyright.

All of the avr-libc files are now distributed under a single license.
All of the authors of the files agreed to this step.  The new license
is a 3-clause simplified ``BSD-style'' license which is believed to be
fully compatible with the GPL on one hand, yet imposes as minimal
restrictions as possible for any kind of commercial use in
applications based on avr-libc.

To build the documentation, doxygen-1.3.4 or newer is strongly recommended.

*** Changes in avr-libc-1.0:

* Move source to cvs repositiory at http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/avr-libc

Anonymous cvs access to the source is now available. There is also a mailing
list set up for discussion of development of avr-libc.

* License changes.

All the files in the project now are covered by a modified BSD license. This 
allows royalty free use of the library in commerical products. All of the 
public domain files in the project have been switched to the new license and
copyright given to the contributors of the files.

There were some files taken from GNU GPL'd projects which were removed from
avr-libc to simplify the licensing. The removed files only supplied alternate
implementations, so nothing was lost by their removal.

* Requires latest binutils and gcc

Marek did some fairly major work with binutils and gcc to make adding support
for new devices easier. His changes in those tools required changes to
avr-libc which make it incompatible with older versions of binutils and gcc.
Gcc versions >= 3.3 and binutils versions >= 2.13 are required.

* New malloc implementation.

Joerg Wunsch has supplied an improved malloc implementation which is less
prone to fragmentation.

* Documentation!

Joerg Wunsch and Ted Roth and have been working on using the doxygen program to
embed documentation comments into source code. Additionally, Harald Kipp's 
inline asm cookbook and Rich Neswold's Avr Tools document have been merged into
the user manual. The goal is to have a single place for all the documentation
a user would need to get started developing for AVR microcontrollers using
the GNU development tool chain.

The latest documentation is available online at
  http://www.freesoftware.fsf.org/avr-libc/

* I/O registers accessible directly in C expressions

You can now do this in your code:
  PORTA |= 0x02;

See the "Special Function Registers" documentation for details. This method is
preferred over the use of the deprecated inp(), inb(), inw(), outp(), outb()
and outw() functions.

* New devices supported

mega128
mega169
mega16
mega32
mega64 [untested]
mega8515 [untested]
mega8535 [untested]
tiny26
76c711
43usb320
43usb355
86rf401

* Improved trigonometrical functions:

Reiner Patommel provided complete rewrites for asin(), atan() and atan2()
that feature a better (for some argument ranges even much better)
accuracy than the previous versions.  Note that since acos() uses asin(),
it also benefits from this.

* Incompatibilities with previous version.

The arguments for outb()/outw() have been reversed.
  (value,port) -> (port,value)

* New pgmspace.h API.

Changed function names and added new functions to read the Program Space
FLASH. Added new functions to read 16-bit (word) values. The new API should 
also clear up problems with reading data from devices with > 64K of FLASH.

The API now includes:
pgm_read_byte       (maps to the *_near function below)
pgm_read_word       (maps to the *_near function below)
pgm_read_byte_near
pgm_read_word_near
pgm_read_byte_far
pgm_read_word_far


* New bootloader support API.

#include <avr/boot.h>

This provides bootloader support functions to those processors that have 
builtin bootloader support.

* inb / outb / inw / outw / cbi / sbi macros are deprecated.

* New string functions and optimized string functions.

strlcpy   (optimized)
strlcat   (optimized)
strsep    (new)
strtok_r  (new)
strlcat_P (new)
strlcpy_P (new)
strncat_P (new)

Contributed by Reiner Patommel with some work on strlcpy, strlcat by
Eric Weddington.

* New eeprom functions by Artur Lipowski <LAL@pro.onet.pl>

eeprom_write_word
eeprom_write_block
