  [no-id] Add RAMSTART, fix RAMSIZE, RAMEND and FLASHEND in device headers
  [#8512] Rename tiny arch to avrtiny to sync with binutils

* Other changes:

  - New macro _PROTECTED_WRITE(): write to Xmega IO registers that are
    protected through the CCP mechanism

  - Add support for scanf() conversion macros for 8-bit data types to
    <inttypes.h>: SCNd8, SCNdLEAST8, SCNdFAST8, SCNi8, SCNiLEAST8,
    SCNiFAST8, SCNo8, SCNoLEAST8, SCNoFAST8, SCNu8, SCNuLEAST8,
    SCNuFAST8, SCNx8, SCNxLEAST8, SCNxFAST8

  - Add time.h package, C standard functions such as mktime() and localtime,
    along with 'ephemera' such as solar declination, time of sun rise and set.

  - Introduce new configure option --with-debug-info=INFO, where INFO
    can be either stabs, dwarf-2, or dwarf-4.  By default, no debug
    information will be generated.

  - Add IO register debug symbols to crt*.o, so debuggers can see the
    per-device defined IO registers (and __eeprom).

  - A number of changes have been applied to make avr-libc more C++
    aware.

*** Changes in avr-libc-1.8.0:

* Bugs fixed:

* New devices supported:

* Contributed Patches:

  [#7531] Bad name of bit in TCCR0A : WGM0 instead of CTC0 for ATtinyX61
  [#7362] iom16a.h: USART vectors inconsistently named for ATmega16A
  [#7226] ATMEGA8U2 Patches

* Other changes:

  - The old prog_* typedefs are now deprecated, and are only included
  if requested by the user.  This request is expressed by declaring
  the macro __PROG_TYPES_COMPAT__, either by a #define directive
  before including <avr/pgmspace.h>, or by a -D compiler option.

  - Optimized strlen_P, thanks to Jan Waclawek. Rename strlen_P to be
  __strlen_P and add new strlen_P inline function in header file that
  checks if value is a constant and known at compile time. If not,
  then the new inline function calls __strlen_P as normal.

* Other changes:

  - Added 'avr35' architecture. Now 'MOVW' and 'LPM Rx, Z[+]' instructions
    supported for AT90USB82 and AT90USB162 devices. GCC 4.3 or above is
    necessary to use this.

  - Function vfscanf() is rewriten. The float point version is optimized
    considerably: the expense of a stack was cut by half, and the size of
    function has decreased approximately on 1KB. Opportunities of standard
    and minimal versions are expanded, and their size has remained at a
    former level.

    Briefly:
      . Restrictions of a float point format are eliminated.
      . Conversion '%[' is present in standart version now.
      . The minimal version differs from standard only absence of '%[' conv.
      . The 'hh' type qualifier is added ('char *', C99).
      . The maximal field width is increased up to 255 (65535 in float version).
      . All known bugs are fixed.

    New vfscanf() concedes old in:
      . The size of the minimal and standard versions has increased for old
      branches of compiler (less 4.1) and ancient chips (without MOVW).
      . The maximum quantity of conversions now is limited (255).

  - EEPROM functions are rewriten.  Now they are pure asm functions.  The
    reading of long word or block is speed up.  New functions for 32-bit
    words and floats are added.  The group of 'update' (burn only different
    bytes) functions is added.  A set of Avr-libc bugs are fixed.

  - Added support for XMEGA architectures.

  - The Postscript documentation build has been removed in favour of
    building only the PDF (and HTML and man page) versions.  PDF offers
    the same printing quality as postscript at a smaller file size.
    This also works around a bug in doxygen 1.5.7 where it appears to
    be no longer possible to set GENERATE_HTML = NO.

  - A sleeping BOD API was added to <avr/sleep.h>. This allows you to disable
    the Brown Out Detector (BOD) before going to sleep, thereby reducing
    power even further.

  - The note about signbit() implementation is removed from documenatation.
    The reason is that the GCC can replace it with inline code and the
    nonzero value is unpredictable in such case.

  - Signature API added in <avr/signature.h>.

  - All functions are now placed in the .text.avr-libc section, and the
    floating point functions are placed in the .text.avr-libc.fplib section. This
    allows the user the ability to relocate all avr-libc routines to a different
    address using a custom linker script.

  - The port/pin assignments of the HD44780 LCD controller in the
    stdiodemo example can now be distributed across more than a single
    AVR port.  The only remaining requirement is that all data bits
    are assigned to a single port in ascending order.

  - Added support for avrtiny10 architecture, to support the ATtiny10 Family.

  - Added new headerfile: <avr/cpufunc.h>; currently contains _NOP() and
    _MemoryBarrier().

  - The twidemo can now optionally address 24C32 and larger EEPROMs
    that require 16-bit word addressing.

  - Add a "memory barrier" to the cli() and sei() macros.

*** Changes in avr-libc-1.6.0:

* Main changes from avr-libc 1.4 to 1.6:

  + The fplib/math library is completely rewritten. Now features of the IEEE
  754 standard are supported all: negative zero, subnormals, Infs and NaNs.
  It concerns both to base operations (arithmetic, comparison...), and to
  all functions. Speed of performance is increased, sometimes considerably.
  A number of mistakes (not reflected in the Bugs) which led severe losses
  of accuracy for some arguments is corrected. A number of new functions is
  added. It is necessary to note, that the new library concedes old under
  the charge of flash memory a little.

    Incompatibilities:

    - Conversion from float to long (make similar to GCC/x86):  in case if
    overflow was or if input is NaN return 0x80000000 for signed result and
    return 0 for unsigned result. Negative input (not too big in absolute
    value) is permissible for cast to unsigned long, for example: (unsigned
    long)(-1.0) returns ULONG_MAX.

    - The signbit() function: return 1 as nonzero value (make similar to
    builtin GCC).

    - Make frexp() similar to GCC/x86 in case of nonfinite arg: write 0 by
    exponent pointer. Early Avr-libc's frexp() skips exponent storing in this
    case. Make the NULL a legal address to skip a storing.

  + Functions of numbers to ascii conversion are completely rewritten:
  dtostre(), dtostrf() and printf() family. They more do not use float point
  operations. Speed of int/float to ascii has increased in some times. For
  printf() the stack usage is reduced.

  + Test suite is added to the Avr-libc project.

  + A few new util's headers: util/atomic.h, util/setbaud.h .

* Other changes:

  - New Power Management API in <avr/power.h>. This provides C language
    macros to manipulate the Power Reduction Register(s) and the System Clock
    Prescaler register across multiple processors.

  [patch #4611] sleep.h sleep_mode() not interrupt safe

  - The simple demo has been modernized a bit.  Documentation now
    generally refers to the ATmega8 rather than the AT90S2313, and
    the #ifdef spaghetti has been moved out into iocompat.h.

  - A new demo project ("largedemo") has been added.  It extends
    the simple demo by adding some controls, and thereby touches
    a good number of avr-libc concepts.  It has originally been
    written for the ATmega16, but can also be run on an ATmega8
    or a member of the ATmegaX8 family, as well as on an ATtiny2313.

  - Another demo project ("stdiodemo") has been added.  It
    demonstrates the setup of the standard IO facilities using
    a practical small application.

  - The demo projects now install their source code as part of
    the documentation tree.

  - The simple demo has been ported to ATmega8515, ATmega8535,
    ATmega164P, ATmega165, ATmega169, ATmega324P, ATmega325,
    ATmega3250, ATmega329, ATmega3290, ATmega640, ATmega644,
    ATmega644P, ATmega645, ATmega6450, ATmega649, ATmega6490,
    ATmega1280, ATmega1281, ATtiny2313, ATtiny24, ATtiny25, ATtiny26,
    ATtiny261, ATtiny44, ATtiny45, ATtiny461, ATtiny84, ATtiny85,
    ATtiny861.

  - More overhaul of the demo documentation, don't use the "squid"
    cable for the largedemo as it is not part of the STK500.

  - Integrate a copy of the license file into the documentation.

  - Include an alphabetical index of all globals (functions,
    macros, types, variables) into the documentation.

  - Added 'avr25' architecture. Now 'MOVW' and 'LPM Rx, Z[+]' instructions
    supported for AT86RF401, ATtiny13, ATtiny2313, ATtiny24, ATtiny25,
    ATtiny261, ATtiny44, ATtiny45, ATtiny461, ATtiny84, ATtiny85 and
    ATtiny861 devices. GCC 4.2 or above is necessary to use this.

  - Add the benchmark page.

*** Changes in avr-libc-1.4.0:

* Major API changes:

  - The INTERRUPT() macro has been deprecated, and it will be
    removed in a future version.  Use __attribute__((interrupt))
    explicitly if this functionality is really needed.

  - A new ISR() macro has been added, and is now the preferred
    for to introduce an interrupt service routine.  It is
    equivalent to the old SIGNAL() macro, which might become
    deprecated in a future version.

  - A new header file, <compat/deprecated.h> has been established.
    Its purpose is to collect deprecated items from older versions of
    the library, starting out with the enable_external_int(),
    timer_enable_int(), and INTERRUPT() macros/functions, as well as
    the old obsoleted inp/outp/sbi/cbi macros.

  - A new include file subdirectory named "util/" has been created.
    The files <compat/twi.h>, <avr/crc16.h>, <avr/delay.h>, and
    <avr/parity.h> have been moved into the new util/ subdirectory.

  - A new set of interrupt vector names has been added, closely
    matching the names given in the datasheet, and more compatible to
    other compilers available for the AVR platform.  The table of
    interrupt vector names in the documentation is now automatically
    generated, and explicitly mentions the MCU type for each vector
    name.

  - The standard IO facilities API has been enhanced

    . The backend functions put and get that are passed to fdevopen()
      during the setup of a stream now take the stream itself as an
      additional argument.
      By defining the macro __STDIO_FDEVOPEN_COMPAT_12 before
      including <stdio.h>, an fdevopen() function prototype will be
      declared that is backwards-compatible with avr-libc version
      1.2 and before.
    . It is possible to tie user data to a stream using
      fdev_set_udata(), and to retrieve them using fdev_get_udata().
      Together with the additional argument to the backend functions,
      these functions can now e.g. keep track of internal user state,
      or distinguish two different devices using the same backend
      function.
    . The get backend function can now return _FDEV_EOF to indicate an
      end-of-file condition, in addition to _FDEV_ERR for an error
      condition.  This will affect the internal state that can be
      queried using the standard feof() and ferror() functions.
    . A new macro fdev_setup_stream() is provided to setup a
      user-supplied stream without the need to call fdevopen(), and thus
      without requiring malloc().  A similar macro FDEV_SETUP_STREAM()
      exists that can be used to initialized a FILE object.  The
      floating-point implementations of vfscanf() and vfprintf() now
      allocate their conversion buffer on the stack, so they do not need
      malloc() anymore either.

  - An API has been added to track the library version number.  See the
    documentation of the new header file <avr/version.h>.

  [#11732] Update doc/examples/progmem.c to use the latest API.

* Extend stdio and pmstring APIs:

Implement patch #3516: printf: Handling of argument strings from
program memory

The %S format can now be used to print strings that are located in
program-space memory (aka. ROM).

As a prerequisite for this, the function strnlen_P() has been added
which is similar to strnlen() except that it takes a pointer to a
program-space string.

* Bugs fixed:

  [no-id] Fix TICIE1 value in usb header files.
  [no-id] Fix bug introduced in fix for bug #7802 (missing parens).

          NOTE: boot_lock_bits_set() was broken. Please see the new
          documentation for examples of how the new version works.
  [#8452] some SFR and bit names in iom169.h are incorrect
          NOTE: Where possible, the old names are retained to avoid breaking
          existing code, but the OCR1A and OCR1B names where just plain wrong
          so they have been changed and the incorrect names (OCRA1 and OCRB1)
          are undefined.

* Remove deprecated items:
  + obsolete headers from the base include directory (moved to the avr/
    subdirectory long ago)
  + deprecated macros and functions from
    . <avr/eeprom.h> (eeprom_rb, eeprom_rw, eeprom_wb),
    . <avr/io.h>  (cbi, sbi, inb, outb, inw, outw, inp, outp, BV),
    . <avr/pgmspace.h> (PRG_RDB).
  + . <avr/timer.h> removed completely.

* Moved header files:

  + <avr/ina90.h> moved to <compat/ina90.h>
  + <avr/twi.h> moved to <compat/twi.h>

* New devices supported:

  + ATmega165
  + ATmega325
  + ATmega3250
  + ATmega645
  + ATmega6450
  + ATmega48
  + ATmega88
  + ATmega168
  + ATtiny13
  + ATtiny2313
  + AT90CAN128

* Pin names for ports are now consistent for all devices.

* dtostrf() now uses movw where possible

* realloc() has been implemented.

* Extend pgmspace API.

The pgmspace API has had the following macros added to allow accessing of
unsigned 32-bit values:

  pgm_read_dword_near
  pgm_read_dword_far
  pgm_read_dword

* Change boot API.

The boot API internals have changed such that it is not compatible with the
1.0.x API.

These macros have been changed so that they no longer wait for SPM and EEPROM
operations to complete. It turns out that doing those checks all the time is
not needed and tends to bloat the code. Removing the checks allows you to
write more compact code (see the example in avr/boot.h).

  boot_page_fill
  boot_page_erase
  boot_page_write
  boot_rww_enable
  boot_lock_bits_set

If you want the old behaviour (1.0.x compatible), use these new macros:

  boot_page_fill_safe
  boot_page_erase_safe
  boot_page_write_safe
  boot_rww_enable_safe
  boot_lock_bits_set_safe

* Extend eeprom API.

New macro:
  eeprom_busy_wait

* Extend crc16 API.

New functions:
  _crc_xmodem_update
  _crc_ccitt_update

* Extend stdio API.

New functions:
  vfprintf_P
  vfscanf_P
  vsprintf
  vsprintf_P
  vsnprintf
  vsnprintf_P

* Extend malloc API.

Implement realloc().

* Extend delay API (<avr/delay.h>).

Implement inline functions for specifying delays in microseconds, or
milliseconds directly (based on the macro F_CPU specifying the CPU
clock frequency).

* Documentation changes:

  + Use newer Doxygen.
  + Many fixes and added documentation.
  + Unix-style man pages are generated now when doc generation has been
    enabled in ./configure

* Optimize slightly strtol and strtoul functions.

* Unified copyright.

All of the avr-libc files are now distributed under a single license.
All of the authors of the files agreed to this step.  The new license
is a 3-clause simplified ``BSD-style'' license which is believed to be
fully compatible with the GPL on one hand, yet imposes as minimal
restrictions as possible for any kind of commercial use in
applications based on avr-libc.

To build the documentation, doxygen-1.3.4 or newer is strongly recommended.

*** Changes in avr-libc-1.0:

* Move source to cvs repositiory at http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/avr-libc

Anonymous cvs access to the source is now available. There is also a mailing
list set up for discussion of development of avr-libc.

* License changes.

All the files in the project now are covered by a modified BSD license. This
allows royalty free use of the library in commerical products. All of the
public domain files in the project have been switched to the new license and
copyright given to the contributors of the files.

There were some files taken from GNU GPL'd projects which were removed from
avr-libc to simplify the licensing. The removed files only supplied alternate
implementations, so nothing was lost by their removal.

* Requires latest binutils and gcc

Marek did some fairly major work with binutils and gcc to make adding support
for new devices easier. His changes in those tools required changes to
avr-libc which make it incompatible with older versions of binutils and gcc.
Gcc versions >= 3.3 and binutils versions >= 2.13 are required.

* New malloc implementation.

Joerg Wunsch has supplied an improved malloc implementation which is less
prone to fragmentation.

* Documentation!

Joerg Wunsch and Ted Roth and have been working on using the doxygen program to
embed documentation comments into source code. Additionally, Harald Kipp's
inline asm cookbook and Rich Neswold's Avr Tools document have been merged into
the user manual. The goal is to have a single place for all the documentation
a user would need to get started developing for AVR microcontrollers using
the GNU development tool chain.

The latest documentation is available online at
  http://www.freesoftware.fsf.org/avr-libc/

* I/O registers accessible directly in C expressions

You can now do this in your code:
  PORTA |= 0x02;

See the "Special Function Registers" documentation for details. This method is
preferred over the use of the deprecated inp(), inb(), inw(), outp(), outb()
and outw() functions.

* New devices supported

mega128
mega169
mega16
mega32
mega64 [untested]
mega8515 [untested]
mega8535 [untested]
tiny26
76c711
43usb320
43usb355
86rf401

* Improved trigonometrical functions:

Reiner Patommel provided complete rewrites for asin(), atan() and atan2()
that feature a better (for some argument ranges even much better)
accuracy than the previous versions.  Note that since acos() uses asin(),
it also benefits from this.

* Incompatibilities with previous version.

The arguments for outb()/outw() have been reversed.
  (value,port) -> (port,value)

* New pgmspace.h API.

Changed function names and added new functions to read the Program Space
FLASH. Added new functions to read 16-bit (word) values. The new API should
also clear up problems with reading data from devices with > 64K of FLASH.

The API now includes:
pgm_read_byte       (maps to the *_near function below)
pgm_read_word       (maps to the *_near function below)
pgm_read_byte_near
pgm_read_word_near
pgm_read_byte_far
pgm_read_word_far


* New bootloader support API.

#include <avr/boot.h>

This provides bootloader support functions to those processors that have
builtin bootloader support.

* inb / outb / inw / outw / cbi / sbi macros are deprecated.

* New string functions and optimized string functions.

strlcpy   (optimized)
strlcat   (optimized)
strsep    (new)
strtok_r  (new)
strlcat_P (new)
strlcpy_P (new)
strncat_P (new)

Contributed by Reiner Patommel with some work on strlcpy, strlcat by
Eric Weddington.

* New eeprom functions by Artur Lipowski <LAL@pro.onet.pl>

eeprom_write_word
eeprom_write_block
