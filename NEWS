*** Changes since avr-libc-20020203:

* Move source to cvs repositiory at http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/avr-libc

Anonymous cvs access to the source is now available. There is also a mailing
list set up for discussion of development of avr-libc.

* License changes.

All the files in the project now are covered by a modified BSD license. This 
allows royalty free use of the library in commerical products. All of the 
public domain files in the project have been switched to the new license and
copyright given to the contributors of the files.

There were some files taken from GNU GPL'd projects which were removed from
avr-libc to simplify the licensing. The removed files only supplied alternate
implementations, so nothing was lost by their removal.

* Requires latest binutils and gcc

Marek did some fairly major work with binutils and gcc to make adding support
for new devices easier. His changes in those tools required changes to avr-libc
which make it incompatible with older versions of binutils and gcc. Gcc version
3.3 (still in cvs) and binutils version 2.14 (still in cvs) are required.
Binutils 2.13 is also acceptable.

* New malloc implementation.

Joerg Wunsch has supplied an improved malloc implementation which is less
prone to fragmentation.

* Documentation!

Joerg Wunsch and Ted Roth and have been working on using the doxygen program to
embed documentation comments into source code. Additionally, Harald Kipp's 
inline asm cookbook and Rich Neswold's Avr Tools document have been merged into
the user manual. The goal is to have a single place for all the documentation
a user would need to get started developing for AVR microcontrollers using
the GNU development tool chain.

The latest documentation is available online at
  http://www.freesoftware.fsf.org/avr-libc/

* I/O registers accessible directly in C expressions

You can now do this in your code:
  PORTA |= 0x02;

See the "Special Function Registers" documentation for details.

* New devices supported

mega128
mega169
mega16
mega32
mega64 [untested]
mega8515 [untested]
mega8535 [untested]
tiny26

* Improved trigonometrical functions:

Reiner Patommel provided complete rewrites for asin(), atan() and atan2()
that feature a better (for some argument ranges even much better)
accuracy than the previous versions.  Note that since acos() uses asin(),
it also benefits from this.

* Incompatibilities with previous version.

The arguments for outb()/outw() have been reversed.
  (value,port) -> (port,value)
