/* long __fixsfsi (float A);
     The __fixsfsi() function converts A to the integer value. No rounding,
     the fractional is lost. The compiler calls this function to perform
     a cast operation from float (i.e. double) to long. No saturation.

   Return:
     The integral part of A. If A is too big (i.e. A is less then
     -0x0.ffffffp+31 or A is great then +0x0.ffffffp+31), this realization
     returns the LONG_MIN value (i.e. 0x80000000). If A is not a number,
     also LONG_MIN is returned.

   See '__fixunssfsi.S' why saturation is't used.
