    Compute the ISO 8601 week date corresponding to the given year and day of year.
    See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date for a full description. To summarize:

        Weeks are numbered from 1 to 53.
        Week days are numbered 1 to 7, beginning with Monday as day 1.

        The first week of the year contains the first Thursday in that year.
        Dates prior to week 1 belong to the final week of the previous year.

        The final week of the year contains the last Thursday in that year.
        Dates after the final week belong to week 1 of the following year.
