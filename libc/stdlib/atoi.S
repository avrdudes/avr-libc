   TODO: this implementation uses an inline isspace(). If AVR-LibC will
   use locales other than C/POSIX it is needed to call an external isspace().

   ATTENTION: an external __mulhi_const_10() function is used: nonstandart
   call conventions: some registers and bit T must be nochanged.

/** \ingroup avr_stdlib
    \fn int atoi(const char *s)
    \brief Convert a string to an integer.

    The atoi() function converts the initial portion of the string
    pointed to by \p s to integer representation. In contrast to

        \code (int)strtol(s, (char **)NULL, 10); \endcode

    this function does not detect overflow (\c errno is not changed and
    the result value is not predictable), uses smaller memory (flash and
    stack) and works more quickly.
