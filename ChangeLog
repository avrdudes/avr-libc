	* avr-libc.spec.in: New file.

2002-07-05  Theodore A. Roth  <troth@verinet.com>

	* configure.in (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Updated version.

2002-06-20  Marek Michalkiewicz  <marekm@amelek.gda.pl>
	* crt1/gcrt1.S: Check GCC version (3.2 required, 3.1 will not work).
	Set __heap_end to 0 so the symbol is defined for malloc().
	* include/stdlib.h: Declare __malloc_margin, __malloc_heap_start
	and __malloc_heap_end.
	* include/io*.h: Rename OVR bit to DOR.
	* include/iom161.h: Define the same bits for both UARTs.
	Define SPMCR bits.

2002-06-12  Marek Michalkiewicz  <marekm@amelek.gda.pl>
	* crt1/gcrt1.S: Fix bug with interrupt vectors always pointing to
	the reset address (no __vector_* relocs) on all <=8K chips.  Oops.
	This also restores the "handle unexpected interrupts" feature that
	was present in the old gcrt1.S - define a "signal" function named
	__vector_default to handle all interrupts not handled elsewhere.
	* doc/INSTALL: Update.

2002-06-01  Marek Michalkiewicz  <marekm@amelek.gda.pl>
	* Rewrite gcrt1.S, make use of the new ld scripts that allow
	inserting user code at various stages of initialization.

2002-05-31  Marek Michalkiewicz  <marekm@amelek.gda.pl>
	* Rewrite I/O access macros so that you can use I/O registers
	directly in C expressions.  See <sfr_defs.h> for description.
	Many files changed, please test - I have tried to maintain some
	backwards compatibility, but applications (especially assembler
	sources) will need to be modified.  Also check C code for any
	outb/outw macro calls as now their arguments are in the correct
	(port, value) order, consistent with C assignment operators.

2002-05-30  Marek Michalkiewicz  <marekm@amelek.gda.pl>
	* Fix multilib build failure (some *.S files) after the 20020529 GCC
	changes in handling of predefined __AVR_AT*__ preprocessor macros.
	Do not set AM_CFLAGS in Makefile.am files.  Add our own rules that
	add AVRLIB_ASFLAGS after CFLAGS, so that our -mmcu=atmega103 comes
	after multilib -mmcu=avr3 (not the other way around), now that the
	last -mmcu=* option completely overrides any previous one.
	* Move gcrt1.S from libc/ into a new crt1/ directory.
	* Move libc/bsd/*.c to libc/stdlib/ and remove libc/bsd/ directory.
	* Move strlcat.c and strlcpy.c from libc/stdlib/ to libc/string/ .
	* Add "set -e" and do "make distcheck" in dodist script.
	* libc/stdlib/malloc.c: New implementation, thanks to Joerg Wunsch.

2002-05-26  Marek Michalkiewicz  <marekm@amelek.gda.pl>
	The patch mentioned below is now in the binutils CVS tree.
	* Add copyright notices to all files in preparation for moving
	the project to savannah.gnu.org.  Thanks to Theodore A. Roth
	<troth@verinet.com> for help with this boring task...
	* Remove libc/gnu/ subdir and include/string-avr.h (LGPL).
	* Update doc/avr-libc-reference.html (string-avr.h gone).

2002-05-11  Marek Michalkiewicz  <marekm@amelek.gda.pl>

	binutils with applied patch from

	* include/pgmspace.h (strncasecmp_P): Add missing third argument.
	* include/string.h (strlcat, strlcpy): Declare.
	* libc/gcrt1.S (__stack): Weak, default to RAMEND from <io*.h>.

	* Add ltoa() and ultoa(), thanks to Reiner Patommel.
	* Optimize parity_even_bit, thanks to Greg Smith.
	* doc/avr-libc-reference.html: Fix CR/LF newlines.

Sun Jan 06 00:11:00 2002  Reinhard Jessich  <reinhard.jessich@telering.at>
	* configure.in: Add the "-g" option to AVRLIB_CFLAGS.
	* reconf: Add "set -x" to see whta is executed.
	* Makefile.am: Remove the comment about automake 1.4.

Sat Dec 29 22:44:00 2001  Reinhard Jessich  <reinhard.jessich@telering.at>
	* Bugfix in configure.in: Now avr-libc can be configured, without
	  a present avr-libc installed.
	
Sat Dec 29 01:29:00 2001  Reinhard Jessich  <reinhard.jessich@telering.at>
	* libm is working with autoconf/automake, too.
	* Create the new distribution package avr-libc-20011229.tar.gz.
	
Sat Dec 28 23:34:00 2001  Reinhard Jessich  <reinhard.jessich@telering.at>
	* libc is working with autoconf/automake.
	
Sat Dec 22 22:12:00 2001  Reinhard Jessich  <reinhard.jessich@telering.at>
	* First tries to use the autoconf/automake for the building of the avr libc.
	
see doc/CHANGES for old changes (before autoconf/automake) support.
