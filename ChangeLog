	Fix broken seeding of the PRNGs when seeding with 0.
	This fix is courtesy Andrew Chernov from the FreeBSD
	project (rev. 1.21 of their random.c).
	* libc/stdlib/random.c (do_random): seed with another (arbitrary) value
	when attempting to seed with 0.
	* libc/stdlib/rand.c (do_rand): (Ditto.)
	Closes bug #18662: rand() keeps returning the same value if seeded with 0
