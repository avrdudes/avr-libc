	* include/avr/boot.h (boot_lock_bits_set): Fix a typo: BLB11 needs
	to be programmed (rather than BLB12) in order to prevent the
	application from overwriting the boot loader section.
	Closes bug #18115: online documentation typo/bug avr/boot.h

	* include/stdio.h: Document that malloc() is no longer needed for
	floating-point conversions as it once used to be.
	Closes bug #18688: vfscanf and vfprintf don't use malloc

	Fix broken seeding of the PRNGs when seeding with 0.
	This fix is courtesy Andrew Chernov from the FreeBSD
	project (rev. 1.21 of their random.c).
	* libc/stdlib/random.c (do_random): seed with another (arbitrary) value
	when attempting to seed with 0.
	* libc/stdlib/rand.c (do_rand): (Ditto.)
	Closes bug #18662: rand() keeps returning the same value if seeded with 0
